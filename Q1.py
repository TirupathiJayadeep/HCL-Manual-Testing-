
'''Write a Python program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit
binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not.
The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated
sequence.
Example:
0100,0011,1010,1001
Then the output should be:
1010'''

for i in lst:
    if int(i,2)%5==0:
        out.append(i)
